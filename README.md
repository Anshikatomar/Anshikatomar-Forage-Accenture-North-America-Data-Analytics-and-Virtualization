This virtual internship program involves using tools like Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft PowerPoint for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and creating insights. The goal is to leverage these tools to answer business-related questions effectively and present data-driven findings

Client Overview and Background: Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a major social media company, launched in San Francisco with a focus on content rather than individual users. The platform maintains user anonymity and emphasizes content reactions, offering over 100 types beyond likes, dislikes, and comments to keep content at the forefront.

What problem they are facing/Why External Expertise is Needed:
Despite having reached this stage without external consulting, Social Buzz now seeks to engage an advisory firm for three main reasons:
1. IPO Preparation: With plans to go public by the end of next year, Social Buzz requires strategic advice to ensure a smooth IPO process.
2. Scaling Challenges: As a relatively small company facing rapid growth, Social Buzz lacks the internal resources to effectively manage its scale. Instead of expanding its team, the company prefers to leverage the expertise of a seasoned consulting firm.
3. Data Management Best Practices: Given the massive volume of data generated daily, Social Buzz is keen to learn best practices from large corporations on how to manage big data challenges effectively.

Initial Engagement Proposal:
To demonstrate our capabilities, we will undertake a three-month initial project, focusing on the following key deliverables:
1. Conducting an audit of Social Buzz's big data practices.
2. Providing strategic recommendations for a successful IPO.
3. Analyzing their content categories to identify the top five categories by aggregate popularity.

To accomplish the project objectives, it has been structured into four tasks:
- Task 1: Understand the project scope, client requirements, and familiarize yourself with the team members.
- Task 2: Perform data cleaning using Excel or any other platform of your choice.
- Task 3: Conduct data visualization and analysis using Power BI dashboards or another tool, and prepare a presentation for the client.
- Task 4: Record a video of yourself presenting the findings to the client.
