Task 2: Data Cleaning and Modeling
In this task, I was provided with three datasets: "Reactions," "Content," and "Reaction Types." 
The objective was to clean and preprocess the data to ensure it was ready for analysis. The key steps involved:

1. Data Cleaning: This included removing unnecessary values or columns that were not useful for analysis, handling missing data, and 
adjusting data types as needed for consistency and accuracy.
2. Data Merging: The cleaned datasets were then merged into a single, comprehensive dataset to facilitate better analysis.
3. Analysis Objective: The final task was to analyze the combined dataset to identify the top 5 performing content categories based on 
user reactions.

For this task, tools like Excel, Power BI, or any platform of choice could be used to perform the cleaning, merging, and analysis. 
The final output was consolidated into a single spreadsheet for further use in subsequent tasks.
