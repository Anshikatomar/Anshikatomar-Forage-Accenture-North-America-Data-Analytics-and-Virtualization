Task 4: Video Presentation
The final task involved recording a video presentation to effectively communicate the project findings to the client. In this video, 
I presented a comprehensive overview of the project, covering the following key points:

Problem: A clear description of the challenges faced by the client.
Approach: The methodology and steps taken to address the clientâ€™s needs, including data cleaning, merging, and visualization.
Analytics: An explanation of the analytical processes used and the tools leveraged to derive insights.
Insights and Results: A summary of the key findings, top-performing categories, and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
The objective was to demonstrate presentation and communication skills by clearly explaining the project workflow and results. The final deliverable was a recorded video 
showcasing the ability to present data-driven insights effectively.
